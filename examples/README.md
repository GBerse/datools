#Examples

These examples are used to illustrate the function of this library.


1. Processing Raw Kik-Net ground motion files for future site response analysis.
2. Finding the HVSR, empirical transfer function, linear elastic transfer function, and response spectrum for several Kik-Net sites simultaneously. 
3. Calculating kappa and the subsequent kappa scale factor for Darendeli Dmin.
4. Calculating the ground motion parameter based scale factor for Darendeli Dmin.
5. Conducting strength correction on a site profile ("fitting alpha method").
5. Conducting a frequency-dependent equivalent linear site response analysis on multiple sites.
