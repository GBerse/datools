# Examples

These examples are used to illustrate the function of this library.


1. Signal Processing -- downloading motions from Kik-Net and processing them for future site response analysis
2. Small-Strain Site Response -- conducting linear elastic site response analyses on multiple sites concurrently.
3. $D_{min}$ Scale Factor (kappa-based) -- calculating kappa and the subsequent kappa scale factor for Darendeli Dmin.
4. $D_{min}$ Scale Factor (ground motion parameter based) -- calculating the ground motion parameter based scale factor for Darendeli Dmin.
5. Modulus Reduction and Damping Curve (MRD) Adjustments -- incorporating $D_{min}$ scale factors, strength correction, and damping capping into MRD curves.
5. Equivalent Linear Elastic-Frequency Dependent Site Response (EQL-FD) -- how to conduct an EQL-FD analysis in pyStrata.
